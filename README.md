This project focuses on using the Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt words. The encrypt function uses the variable k as a key to transform each letter in the alphabet within the message using the Caesar cipher. Conversely, the decrypt function uses the negative of the key k in the encrypt function to decrypt the message."
